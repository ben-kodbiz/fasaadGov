In May 2025, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pledged $600 billion during Trump\u2019s visit, including $142 billion for defense and $20 billion for AI via DataVolt. In Israel, investments were negligible until the 2020 Abraham Accords, with tacit defense cooperation emerging (e.g., $800 million in Israeli defense exports to Arab states). Public sentiment in Saudi Arabia opposes Israel ties (96% prioritize Palestine, 2023 poll), limiting overt investments. US investments face scrutiny over deliverability due to low oil prices, with only $283 billion of the 2025 pledge detailed.",

Key deals include $500 million in real estate and finance (2008) and $600 million in infrastructure (2017). Bahrain\u2019s focus is on stable US assets to diversify from oil. In Israel, investments emerged post-2020 Abraham Accords, with $50 million in tech startups, reflecting new trade ties. Public opposition, especially from Bahrain\u2019s Shia majority, limits Israel investments due to pro-Palestinian sentiment. Data on Bahrain\u2019s US investments is sparse, as Mumtalakat discloses limited details, but its US portfolio supports economic diversification.
