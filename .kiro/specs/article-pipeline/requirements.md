# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines an intelligent article-to-visualization pipeline that transforms raw journalistic articles into structured data and automatically updates existing D3.js visualizations. The system will serve as an intelligence-gathering tool for exposing corporate complicity, government relationships, and accountability networks by extracting entities, relationships, and structured information from news articles and reports.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to paste any article text into a web interface, so that I can quickly extract structured information without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the pipeline interface THEN the system SHALL display a text area for article input
2. WHEN a user pastes article text THEN the system SHALL accept text input up to 50,000 characters
3. WHEN a user submits an article THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on processing status
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display extracted entities and relationships

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically extract entities (companies, countries, people, crimes) from articles, so that I can build comprehensive databases without manual parsing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article is processed THEN the system SHALL extract organization names with 85%+ accuracy
2. WHEN an article is processed THEN the system SHALL extract country/location names with 90%+ accuracy
3. WHEN an article is processed THEN the system SHALL extract person names with 80%+ accuracy
4. WHEN an article is processed THEN the system SHALL identify relationships between entities
5. WHEN entities are extracted THEN the system SHALL categorize organizations by sector (military, tech, finance, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visualization maintainer, I want extracted data to be automatically formatted into JSON schema, so that it integrates seamlessly with existing D3.js visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entities are extracted THEN the system SHALL format data according to existing JSON schemas
2. WHEN formatting data THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with companies.json structure
3. WHEN formatting data THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with us_interventions.json structure
4. WHEN formatting data THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with arabs_investment.json structure
5. WHEN data is formatted THEN the system SHALL include source attribution and timestamps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want new data to be intelligently merged with existing JSON databases, so that duplicates are avoided and data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data is processed THEN the system SHALL check for existing entities using fuzzy matching
2. WHEN duplicates are detected THEN the system SHALL merge information rather than create duplicates
3. WHEN merging data THEN the system SHALL preserve existing source attributions
4. WHEN merging data THEN the system SHALL update timestamps and add new sources
5. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL flag for manual review

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visualization user, I want D3.js charts to automatically refresh when new data is added, so that I can see updated information immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is successfully merged THEN the system SHALL trigger visualization refresh
2. WHEN visualizations refresh THEN the system SHALL maintain user's current view state when possible
3. WHEN new entities are added THEN the system SHALL highlight new additions in the visualization
4. WHEN refresh occurs THEN the system SHALL complete within 2 seconds for datasets under 10MB
5. WHEN errors occur during refresh THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to track data provenance and sources, so that I can verify information and maintain academic standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is extracted THEN the system SHALL record the original article source URL
2. WHEN data is extracted THEN the system SHALL record extraction timestamp
3. WHEN data is extracted THEN the system SHALL record extraction confidence scores
4. WHEN data is merged THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of all changes
5. WHEN viewing data THEN the system SHALL display source attribution for each data point

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the pipeline to handle various article formats and sources, so that it works with diverse input types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing articles THEN the system SHALL handle plain text input
2. WHEN processing articles THEN the system SHALL handle HTML content with tag stripping
3. WHEN processing articles THEN the system SHALL handle PDF text extraction
4. WHEN processing articles THEN the system SHALL handle multiple languages (English, Arabic, Hebrew)
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the system to validate and sanitize input, so that malicious content cannot compromise the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving input THEN the system SHALL sanitize HTML and remove scripts
2. WHEN processing text THEN the system SHALL validate input length and format
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks
4. WHEN handling files THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security events without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the pipeline to process articles efficiently, so that I can handle large volumes of content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing articles under 5,000 words THEN the system SHALL complete within 10 seconds
2. WHEN processing articles over 5,000 words THEN the system SHALL complete within 30 seconds
3. WHEN multiple articles are queued THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently
4. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide estimated wait times
5. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a data quality manager, I want to review and approve extracted data before it's merged, so that accuracy is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is extracted THEN the system SHALL provide a review interface
2. WHEN reviewing data THEN the system SHALL allow editing of extracted entities
3. WHEN reviewing data THEN the system SHALL allow manual categorization corrections
4. WHEN data is approved THEN the system SHALL proceed with merge operation
5. WHEN data is rejected THEN the system SHALL allow re-processing with different parameters
