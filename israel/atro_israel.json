The campaign has been described as genocidal by multiple sources, involving indiscriminate airstrikes, a total siege, and deliberate starvation tactics. Over 61,000 Palestinians have been killed, with around half being women and children, and over 97,000 injured. The campaign destroyed civilian infrastructure, including 512 attacks on hospitals, killing 759 and wounding 1,000. Over 900 medical workers and 157 journalists were killed. Israel’s actions include blocking humanitarian aid, causing famine, and displacing 90% of Gaza’s population (nearly 2 million people). The International Court of Justice (ICJ) and human rights organizations have cited evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, including intentional targeting of civilians, medical facilities, and aid workers.",
