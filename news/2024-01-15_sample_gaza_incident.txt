Israeli Airstrike Kills 20 Civilians in Gaza Hospital

January 15, 2024 - An Israeli airstrike targeted a hospital in northern Gaza, killing at least 20 civilians including 8 children and 5 medical staff members. The attack occurred during the early morning hours when the hospital was treating wounded civilians from previous bombardments.

The Israeli Defense Forces claimed the hospital was being used as a command center by Hamas militants, but hospital administrators and international observers disputed this claim. Medical staff reported that the facility was clearly marked as a medical facility and was treating only civilian casualties.

This incident is part of the ongoing military operation in Gaza that has resulted in thousands of civilian casualties since October 2023. International human rights organizations have called for an investigation into potential war crimes.

The hospital had been serving as a refuge for displaced families who had nowhere else to go. Witnesses reported that the building was clearly marked with medical symbols and had been coordinating with international aid organizations.
