US Military Base Expansion in Syria Displaces Civilians

August 3, 2024 - The United States military has expanded its operations at a base in northeastern Syria, forcing the displacement of over 200 civilian families from nearby villages. The expansion includes new drone facilities and weapons storage areas.

Local residents reported that US forces gave them 48 hours to evacuate their homes, which have been in their families for generations. The military cited security concerns for the expansion, but provided no compensation or alternative housing for the displaced families.

This expansion is part of the ongoing US military presence in Syria, which has been criticized by human rights organizations for its impact on civilian populations. The base now covers an area three times its original size.

Children from the affected families are no longer able to attend the local school, which is now within the military zone. Several elderly residents have been separated from their extended families due to the forced relocation.
