US Drone Strike in Yemen Kills 12 Civilians at Wedding

February 3, 2024 - A US drone strike in Yemen's Marib province killed 12 civilians, including 4 children, during a wedding celebration. The attack occurred in the evening when families had gathered for a traditional wedding ceremony.

Pentagon officials stated that the strike was targeting suspected Al-Qaeda operatives in the area, but local authorities and witnesses confirmed that only civilians were present at the celebration. The drone strike completely destroyed a tent where the wedding guests were gathered.

This incident highlights the ongoing US military operations in Yemen, which have been conducted with limited oversight and have resulted in numerous civilian casualties over the past decade. Human rights groups have documented hundreds of civilian deaths from US drone operations in the region.

Local tribal leaders condemned the attack and called for compensation for the victims' families. The wedding was for a young couple from the village, and the celebration had been planned for months.

The US has been conducting drone operations in Yemen since 2002 as part of its counterterrorism efforts, but critics argue that the strikes often miss their intended targets and cause significant civilian harm.
