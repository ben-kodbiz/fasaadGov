Human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories

From economy of occupation to economy of genocide
Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation
of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967,
Francesca Albanese*, **
Summary
In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the
Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 investigates the corporate machinery sustaining
the Israeli settler-colonial project of displacement and replacement of the Palestinians in the
occupied territory. While political leaders and Governments shirk their obligations, far too
many corporate entities have profited from the Israeli economy of illegal occupation,
apartheid and now genocide. The complicity exposed by the report is just the tip of the
iceberg; ending it will not happen without holding the private sector accountable, including
its executives. International law recognizes varying degrees of responsibility – each requiring
scrutiny and accountability, particularly in this case, where a people’s self-determination and
very existence are at stake. This is a necessary step to end the genocide and dismantle the
global system that has allowed it.

* The present report was submitted to the conference services for processing after the deadline so as to

I. Introduction
1.
Colonial endeavours and associated genocides have historically been driven and
enabled by the corporate sector,1 Commercial interests have contributed to the dispossession
of Indigenous people of their lands2 – a mode of domination known as “colonial racial
capitalism”.3 The same is true of Israeli colonization of Palestinian lands,4 its expansion into
the occupied Palestinian territory and its institutionalization of a regime of settler-colonial
apartheid.5 After denying Palestinian self-determination for decades, Israel is now imperilling
the very existence of the Palestinian people in Palestine.
2.
The role of corporate entities in sustaining the illegal Israeli occupation and its
ongoing genocidal campaign in Gaza is the subject of the present investigative report, which
is focused on how corporate interests underpin the Israeli settler-colonial twofold logic of
displacement and replacement aimed at dispossessing and erasing Palestinians from their
lands. The Special Rapporteur discusses corporate entities in various sectors: arms
manufacturers, tech firms, building and construction companies, extractive and service
industries, banks, pension funds, insurers, universities and charities. These entities enable the
denial of self-determination and other structural violations in the occupied Palestinian
territory, including occupation, annexation and crimes of apartheid and genocide, as well as
a long list of ancillary crimes and human rights violations, from discrimination, wanton
destruction, forced displacement and pillage to extrajudicial killing and starvation.
3.
Had proper human rights due diligence been undertaken, corporate entities would
have long ago disengaged from Israeli occupation. Instead, post-October 2023, corporate
actors have contributed to the acceleration of the displacement-replacement process
throughout the military campaign that has pulverized Gaza and displaced the largest number
of Palestinians in the West Bank since 1967.6
4.
While it is impossible to fully capture the scale and extent of decades of corporate
connivance in the exploitation of the occupied Palestinian territory, the present report exposes
the integration of the economies of settler-colonial occupation and genocide. In it, the Special
Rapporteur calls for accountability for corporate entities and their executives at both the
domestic and international levels: commercial endeavours enabling and profiting from the
obliteration of innocent people’s lives must cease. Corporate entities must refuse to be
complicit in human rights violations and international crimes or be held to account.

II. Methodology
5.
“Corporate entities” in the present report refers to business enterprises, multinational
corporations, for-profit and not-for-profit entities, whether private, public or State-owned.7
Corporate responsibility applies regardless of the size, sector, operational context, ownership
and structure of the entity.8

6.
In the report, the Special Rapporteur builds on extensive literature, especially by civil
society9 and by the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational
corporations and other business enterprises, on how Israel has created and maintained its own
economy through the occupation, and a captive economy for the Palestinians.
7.
The Special Rapporteur also builds upon, and situates within the broader matrix of the
unlawful Israeli occupation, the database established by the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) pursuant to Human Rights Council
resolutions 31/36 and 53/25. The OHCHR database lists only business enterprises that have
“directly and indirectly enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of
the settlements”.10
8.
The Special Rapporteur developed a database of approximately 1,000 corporate
entities from the unprecedented number of submissions received – more than 200 – following
her call for input when preparing the investigation.11 This helped map how corporate entities
worldwide have been implicated in human rights violations and international crimes in the
occupied Palestinian territory. Over 45 entities named in the report have been duly informed
of the facts that led the Special Rapporteur to formulate a series of allegations: 15 replied.
The complex web of corporate structures – and the often obscured links between parents and
subsidiaries, franchises, joint ventures, licencees etc. – implicates many more. The
investigation behind the present report demonstrates the lengths to which corporations will
go to conceal their complicity.12
9.
The report is complemented by the attached annex, which provides an overview of
the relevant legal framework.

III. Legal context
10.
The law governing corporate responsibility has deep roots in the historic relationship
between violent dispossession and private power, and the legacy of corporate collusion with
settler-colonialism and racial segregation.13
11.
Early charter companies, granted broad State-like powers, gradually evolved into
private “limited liability” corporations as intercolonial trade grew vital to European
economies.14 Colonial powers continued to rely on these relationships to outsource, obscure
and avoid accountability for the dispossession and enslavement of Indigenous Peoples and
the expropriation of their resources.15 Corporations have not only inherited the benefits of
this legal veil of separation, but have also emerged as shapers of international law.16
12.
Today, some corporate conglomerates exceed the gross domestic product (GDP) of
entire sovereign States.17 Sometimes wielding more power – political, economic and
discursive – than States themselves, corporations enjoy increasing recognition as rights
holders, with still insufficient corresponding obligations. The asymmetry of immense power
without sufficiently justiciable accountability exposes a fundamental global governance gap.

13.
Corporations and their home States – primarily global-minority States – continue to
exploit structural inequalities rooted in colonial dispossession. 18 Meanwhile, weaker
regulatory systems in formerly colonized States, and development and investment
imperatives, mean corporations often evade accountability.19
14.
Nevertheless, important precedents exist. The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials,
such as the I.G. Farben trial, laid the groundwork for recognizing the international criminal
responsibility of corporate executives for participation in international crimes. 20 By
addressing corporate complicity in apartheid, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of
South Africa helped shape corporate responsibility for human rights violations.21 Increasing
domestic and international litigation signal a growing trend toward corporate
accountability.22
15.

The case of Palestine further tests international standards.

16.
Today, the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights set out the normative
framework for States’ and corporate entities’ compliance with international law. States have
the primary obligation to prevent, investigate, punish and remedy human rights abuses by
third parties, and may breach their obligations if they fail to do so. The Guiding Principles
crystallize the human rights standards applicable to corporate conduct that apply regardless
of whether States uphold their primary obligations. International humanitarian law and
criminal law also confer specific obligations and liabilities on private actors,23 with domestic
jurisdictions primarily responsible for enforcement.
17.
The Guiding Principles establish a continuum of responsibilities, depending on
whether corporate entities cause, contribute to or are directly linked with adverse human
rights impacts.24 In conflicts, businesses must observe heightened human rights due diligence
to identify concerns and adjust their conduct.25 The liability of corporate entities will be
determined by their actions and by the human rights impact: due diligence is not sufficient to
absolve corporations of liability.26 At a minimum, corporate entities directly linked to human
rights impacts must exercise leverage or consider termination of their activities or
relationships. Failure to act accordingly may give rise to liability. Where violations constitute
crimes, corporate executives and, increasingly, entities themselves, may be held accountable
for their knowledge of and material contributions to crimes.27
18.
In the occupied Palestinian territory, building on decades of documented human rights
violations and crimes, recent judicial developments leave no room for doubt that corporate
engagement with any component of the occupation is connected with violations of jus cogens
norms and international crimes (see annex). Citing racial segregation and apartheid,
violations of the right to self-determination and the prohibition on the use of force, the
International Court of Justice unequivocally affirmed the illegality of the presence of Israel,
including its military presence, colonies and its infrastructure and resource control.28
Furthermore, the atrocities committed since October 2023 triggered proceedings for genocide

before the International Court of Justice, and for war crimes and crimes against humanity
before the International Criminal Court. The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel
to stop creating life-destroying conditions,29 and recently reminded States of their
international obligations to avoid transferring arms that might be used to violate international
conventions.30
19.
These decisions place on corporate entities a prima facie responsibility to not engage
and/or to withdraw totally and unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure
that any engagement with Palestinians enables their self-determination.
20.
Where corporate entities continue their activities and relationships with Israel – with
its economy, military and public and private sectors connected to the occupied Palestinian
territory – they may be found to have knowingly contributed to:
(a)

Violation of the Palestinian right to self-determination;

(b)
Annexation of Palestinian territory, maintenance of an unlawful occupation
and therefore the crime of aggression and associated human rights violations;
(c)

Crimes of apartheid and genocide;

(d)

Other ancillary crimes and violations.

21.
Both criminal and civil laws in various jurisdictions can be invoked to hold corporate
entities or their executives accountable for violations of human rights and/or crimes under
international law.

IV. From the economy of settler-colonial occupation to the
economy of genocide
22.
Settler-colonialism involves extraction and profit from, and colonization of, land
through the expulsion of its owners.31 In Palestine, historically, companies have driven and
enabled the process of displacement and replacement of the Arab population, foundational to
the logic of settler-colonial erasure.32 The Jewish National Fund, a land-purchasing corporate
entity founded in 1901, helped plan and carry out the gradual removal of Arab Palestinians,
which intensified with the Nakba33 and has continued ever since.34
23.
Increasingly aided by corporate entities, Israel has pursued Palestinian dispossession
and displacement, especially after 1967.35 The corporate sector has materially contributed to
this endeavour by providing Israel with the weapons and machinery required to destroy
homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship, livelihoods and productive assets,
such as olive groves and orchards, to segregate and control communities and to restrict access

to natural resources.36 By helping to militarize and incentivize illegal Israeli presence in the
occupied Palestinian territory, the corporate sector has contributed to the creation of the
conditions for Palestinian ethnic cleansing.37
24.
Corporate entities have played a key role in stifling the Palestinian economy, 38
sustaining Israeli expansion in occupied land while facilitating the replacement of
Palestinians. Draconian restrictions – on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and
water for colonies – have debilitated agriculture and industry,39 and turned the occupied
Palestinian territory into a captive market;40 companies have profiteered by exploiting
Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural resources, building and
powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods and services in Israel, the
occupied Palestinian territory and globally.41 The Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip(Oslo II Accords) entrenched this exploitation,42 de facto
institutionalizing the monopoly of Israel over 61 per cent of the resource-rich West Bank
(Area C). Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at least
35 per cent of its GDP.43
25.
Financial and academic institutions have also enabled the conditions for Palestinian
displacement and replacement. Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers
have channelled finance into the illegal occupation. Universities – centres of intellectual
growth and power – have sustained the political ideology underpinning the colonization of
Palestinian land,44 developed weaponry and overlooked or even endorsed systemic
violence,45 while global research collaborations have obscured Palestinian erasure behind a
veil of academic neutrality.
26.
After October 2023, long-standing systems of control, exploitation and dispossession
metamorphosed into economic, technological and political infrastructures mobilized to inflict
mass violence and immense destruction.46 Entities that previously enabled and profited from
Palestinian elimination and erasure within the economy of occupation, instead of disengaging
are now involved in the economy of genocide.
27.
The following sections illustrate how eight key sectors, operating separately and
interdependently through the core pillars of the settler-colonial economy of displacement and
replacement, have adapted to its genocidal practices.

A.

Displacement
28.
Post-October 2023, weapons and military technologies used to advance Palestinian
expulsion have become tools for mass killing and destruction, rendering Gaza and parts of
the West Bank uninhabitable. Surveillance and incarceration technologies, ordinarily used to
enforce segregation/apartheid, have evolved into tools for indiscriminate targeting of the
Palestinian population. Heavy machinery previously used for house demolitions,
infrastructure destruction and resource seizure in the West Bank have been repurposed to
obliterate the urban landscape of Gaza, preventing displaced populations from returning and
reconstituting as a community.
Military sector: the business of elimination
29.
Militarized violence created the State of Israel and remains the engine of its settlercolonial project.47 Israeli and international weapons manufacturers have developed
increasingly effective systems to drive Palestinians off their land. By collaborating and
competing, they have refined technologies that enable Israel to intensify oppression,
repression and destruction.48
30.
Prolonged occupation and repeated military campaigns have provided testing grounds
for cutting-edge military capabilities: air defence platforms, drones, targeting tools powered
by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United States of America.
These technologies are then marketed as “battle-proven”.49
31.
The military-industrial complex has become the economic backbone of the State. 50
Between 2020 and 2024, Israel was the eighth largest arms exporter worldwide. 51 The two
most prominent Israeli weapons companies – Elbit Systems, established as a public-private
partnership and later privatized, and State-owned Israel Aerospace Industries – are among
the top 50 arms manufacturers globally.52 Since 2023, Elbit Systems has cooperated closely
on Israeli military operations,53 embedding key staff in the Ministry of Defense, 54 and was
awarded the 2024 Israeli Defense Prize. Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries
provide a critical domestic supply of weaponry,55 and reinforce Israeli military alliances
through arms exports56 and joint development of military technology.
32.
International partnerships providing weaponry and technical support have enhanced
Israeli capacity to perpetuate apartheid and, recently, to sustain its assault on Gaza. Israel
benefits from the largest-ever defence procurement programme – for the F-35 fighter jet,57
led by United States-based Lockheed Martin,58 alongside at least 1,650 other companies,

including Italian manufacturer Leonardo S.p.A,59 and eight States. Components and parts
constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet, which Israel customizes and
maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and domestic companies.60 Israel was the first
to fly the F-35 in combat, in 2018, and to use it in “beast mode”, in 2025.61 Lockheed Martin
F-35 and F-16 fighter jets, pivotal to the Israeli air force,62 have significant carrying and fire
capacity, including GBU-31 joint direct attack munition (JDAM) and unguided MK-84s
2000-pound bombs; an F-35 can carry over 18,000 pounds of bombs.63 Post-October 2023,
F-35s and F-16s have been integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power
to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs,64 much of it unguided,65 to kill and injure more
than 179,411 Palestinians66 and obliterate Gaza.67
33.
Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines in
the skies of Gaza.68 Drones largely developed and supplied by Elbit Systems and Israel
Aerospace Industries have long flown alongside fighter jets, surveilling Palestinians and
delivering target intelligence.69 In the past two decades, with support from these companies
and collaborations with institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,70
drones used by Israel acquired automated weapons systems and the ability to fly in swarm
formation.71
34.
To supply Israel with these weapons and facilitate arms export and import
transactions, manufacturers depend on a web of intermediaries, including legal, auditing and

FANUC Corporation provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for
Israel Aerospace Industries, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.73 Shipping companies such

For Israeli companies such as Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries, the
ongoing genocide has been a profitable venture. The 65 per cent surge in Israeli military
spending from 2023 to 2024 – amounting to $46.5 billion,75 one of the highest per capita
worldwide – generated a sharp surge in their annual profits. 76 Foreign arms companies,
especially producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.77
Surveillance and carcerality: the dark side of the “start-up nation”
36.
Repression of Palestinians has become progressively automated, with tech companies
providing dual-use78 infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while
profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the occupied
Palestinian territory.79 Fuelled by United States tech giants establishing subsidiaries and
research and development centres in Israel,80 claims by Israel of security needs have spurred
unparalleled developments in carceral and surveillance services, from closed-circuit
television (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced tech checkpoint networks,
“smart walls” and drone surveillance to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and data
analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.81

Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy, 82 as the NSO
Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did.83 Its Pegasus spyware, designed for covert

to target leaders, journalists and human rights defenders. 85 Exported under the Defense
Export Control Law, NSO Group surveillance technology enables “spyware diplomacy”
while reinforcing State impunity.86

IBM has operated in Israel since 1972, training military and intelligence personnel –
especially from Unit 8200 – for the technology sector and start-up scene.87 Since 2019, IBM
Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the Population and Immigration
Authority,88 enabling collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on
Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit regime of Israel.89 Before IBM,
Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) maintained the database and its Israeli subsidiary is still
providing servers.90 Hewlett Packard (HP) has long enabled the apartheid systems of Israel,
supplying technology to the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories
(COGAT), the prison service and police.91 Since the 2015 split of the company into Hewlett
Packard Enterprises and HP Inc., opaque business structures have obscured the roles of their
seven remaining Israeli subsidiaries.92
39.
Microsoft has been active in Israel93 since 1991, developing its largest centre outside
the United States. Its technologies are embedded in the prison service, police, universities
and schools – including in colonies.94 Microsoft has been integrating its systems and civilian
tech across the Israeli military95 since 2003, while acquiring Israeli cybersecurity and
surveillance start-ups.96
40.
As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing
volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown. In 2021, Israel
awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a $1.2 billion contract (Project
Nimbus)97 – largely funded through Ministry of Defense expenditure98 – to provide core tech
infrastructure.

Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon grant Israel virtually government-wide access to
their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing, decisionmaking and surveillance and analysis capacities.99 In October 2023, when the Israeli internal
military cloud overloaded,100 Microsoft, with its Azure platform, and the Project Nimbus
consortium stepped in with critical cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure.101 Their
Israel-located servers ensure data sovereignty and a shield from accountability, 102 under
favourable contracts offering minimal restrictions or oversight. 103 In July 2024, an Israeli
colonel described cloud tech as a weapon in every sense of the word, citing these
companies.104
42.
The Israeli military has developed artificial intelligence systems, such as “Lavender”,
“Gospel” and “Where’s Daddy?” to process data and generate lists of targets,105 reshaping
modern warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature of artificial intelligence. Palantir
Technologies Inc., whose tech collaboration with Israel long predates October 2023,
expanded its support to the Israeli military post-October 2023.106 There are reasonable
grounds to believe Palantir has provided automatic predictive policing technology, core
defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction and deployment of military
software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows real-time battlefield data
integration for automated decision-making.107 In January 2024, Palantir announced a new
strategic partnership with Israel and held a board meeting in Tel Aviv “in solidarity”; 108 in
April 2025, Palantir’s Chief Executive Officer responded to accusations that Palantir had
killed Palestinians in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true”.109 Both incidents are
indicative of executive-level knowledge and purpose vis-à-vis the unlawful use of force by
Israel, and failure to prevent such acts or withdraw involvement.110
43.
Israel as the “start-up nation”, incentivized by the post-9/11 global securitization
boom, has received a significant boost through the genocide. It ranked first globally for the

and with technology comprising 64 per cent of Israeli exports throughout the genocide.111
Civilian guise: heavy machinery in service of settler-colonial destruction
44.
Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial
occupation.112 Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment from leading global
manufacturers to “unground” Palestinians from their land,113 demolishing homes, public
buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure. Since October 2023, this machinery
has been integral to damaging and destroying 70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of
cropland in Gaza.114
45.
For decades, Caterpillar Inc.115 has provided Israel with equipment used to demolish
Palestinian homes and infrastructure,116 through both the United States Foreign Military
Financing programme117 and an exclusive licensee requisitioned by Israeli law into the
military.118 In partnership with companies such as Israel Aerospace Industries,119 Elbit
Systems120 and Leonardo DRS, Inc.-owned RADA Electronic Industries,121 Israel has
evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the
military,122 deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines,
“neutralizing” the territory and killing Palestinians. 123 Since October 2023, Caterpillar
equipment has been documented as being used to carry out mass demolitions124 – including
of homes,125 mosques126 and life-sustaining infrastructure127 – raid hospitals128 and burying

contract with Israel.130
46.
The Korean HD Hyundai131 and its partially owned subsidiary, Doosan,132 alongside
the Swedish Volvo Group133 and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been
linked to the destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through
exclusively licensed Israeli dealers.134 Volvo’s licensee is an OHCHR database-listed
company and together they own Merkavim Transportation Technologies Ltd., which
produces armoured buses sold to service colonies.135 Since at least 2007, Volvo machinery
has been used to raze Palestinian areas, including in East Jerusalem136 and Masafer Yatta.137
For over a decade, HD Hyundai machinery has been used to demolish Palestinian homes 138
and raze farmland, including olive groves.139 After October 2023, Israel increased the use of
the equipment of those companies in the urban destruction of Gaza,140 including in flattening
Rafah141 and Jabalia,142 after which the military obscured their logos.143
47.
These companies have continued supplying the Israeli market despite abundant
evidence of the criminal use of this machinery by Israel and repeated calls from human rights
groups to sever ties.144 Passive suppliers become deliberate contributors to a system of
displacement.

building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading materials, energy and
agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies as if to a regular holiday destination.
Post-October 2023, these activities have sustained unprecedented growth in the settlement
enterprise, with corporate entities continuing to power and profit from the creation of
conditions of life calculated to destroy the Palestinian population, including through the neartotal cutting off of water, electricity and fuel.
Construction: home on stolen land
49.
More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with
by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the
occupied Palestinian territory.145 In 2024, this intensified after the administration of colonies
moved from the military to the civilian Government and the Ministry of Construction and
Housing budget doubled, with $200 million allotted for colony construction.146 From
November 2023 to October 2024, Israel established 57 new colonies and outposts, 147 with
Israeli and international companies supplying machinery, raw materials and logistical
support.
50.
Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators and heavy equipment have been used
in the construction of illegal colonies for at least 10 years. 148 The German Heidelberg
Materials AG,149 through its subsidiary Hanson Israel, has contributed to the pillage of
millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian
villages in the West Bank.150 In 2018, Hanson Israel won a public tender to supply materials
from that quarry for colony construction,151 and has since nearly exhausted the quarry,
prompting ongoing expansion requests.152
51.
Various companies contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure
critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while
excluding and segregating Palestinians.153 The Spanish/Basque Construcciones Auxiliar de
Ferrocarriles154 joined a consortium with a OHCHR database-listed company to maintain and
expand the Jerusalem Light Rail Red Line and build the new Green Line,155 at a time when
other companies had withdrawn owing to international pressure.156 These lines include 27
kilometres of new tracks and 50 new stations in the West Bank, connecting colonies with
West Jerusalem.157 Doosan and Volvo excavators and machinery have been used,158 and
Heidelberg’s subsidiary supplied materials for a light-rail bridge.159

Real estate companies sell properties in colonies to Israeli and international buyers.
The global real estate group, Keller Williams Realty LLC, through its Israeli franchisee KW
Israel,160 has had branches based in the colonies.161 In March 2024, Keller Williams, through
another franchisee, Home in Israel,162 ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United
States,163 jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of
apartments in colonies.164
The grip on natural resources: the incubator of conditions of life calculated to destroy
53.
Since 1967, Israel has exercised systematic control over Palestinian natural resources,
building infrastructure that integrated its colonies into Israeli national systems and entrenched
Palestinian dependency on them.
54.
When Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a “complete siege” on Gaza on
9 October 2023, instantly cutting off water, electricity and fuel,165 this engineered
dependency – designed to displace and control life – was operationalized for genocide. Those
supplies have never been fully restored, contributing to the deliberate creation of conditions
of life calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians as a group.166 This is also why
the grip on resources in the West Bank – tightened after October 2023 – cannot be viewed in
isolation from the destruction unfolding in Gaza.167
Water
55.
Israel forces Palestinians to purchase water sourced from two major aquifers in their
own territory, at inflated prices and with intermittent supply. 168 The Israeli national water
company Mekorot has a water monopoly in the occupied Palestinian territory. 169 In Gaza,
more than 97 per cent of water from the coastal aquifer does not meet the water quality
standards of the World Health Organization, making residents dependent on Mekorot
pipelines for most of their drinking water.170 For at least the first six months post-October
2023, Mekorot ran its Gaza pipelines at 22 per cent capacity, leaving areas such as Gaza City
without water 95 per cent of the time,171 actively aiding the transformation of water into a
tool of genocide.172
Electricity, gas and fuel
56.
International energy companies have fuelled the energy-intensive Israeli genocide.
Reliant on fuel and coal imports,173 Israel maintains an integrated energy infrastructure

serving both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, seamlessly powering illegal settlers
while controlling and obstructing Palestinian access.174 Gaza’s power plant provided just 10
to 20 per cent of Gaza’s electricity needs, leaving it heavily reliant on fuel for generators and
10 Israeli supply lines.175 Since October 2023, Israel has cut energy to most of Gaza. 176
Without electricity or fuel, most water pumps,177 hospitals178 and transport reached the brink
of total collapse;179 collapsed sanitation systems have contributed to a resurgence in polio;180
and vital desalination plants were forced to shut down.181
57.
Coal for electricity to Israel originates primarily from Colombia (60 per cent of Israeli
coal imports in 2023-24);182 United States-headquartered Drummond Company, Inc. and the
Swiss-based Glencore PLC are the primary suppliers. Their respective subsidiaries183 own
the mines and the three ports involved in the delivery of 15 coal shipments to Israel since
October 2023, including six shipments after Colombia suspended coal exports to Israel in
August 2024.184 Glencore was also involved in shipments from South Africa;185 these

supply and the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline.192 At a time of increasing brutality, the
British company BP PLC is expanding involvement in the Israeli economy, with exploration
licences confirmed in March 2025, which allow BP to explore Palestinian maritime expanses
illegally exploited by Israel.193
59.
BP and Chevron are also the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude oil, as
major owners of the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline194 and the Kazakh Caspian
Pipeline Consortium,195 respectively, and of their associated oil fields.196 Each conglomerate
effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil between October 2023 and July 2024,197
supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian oil fields, in which Petrobras holds the
largest stakes,198 and military jet fuel.199 Oil from these companies supplies two refineries in
Israel. From the Haifa refinery, two OHCHR database-listed companies supply their petrol
stations throughout Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, including the colonies,200
and the military, through government-awarded contracts.201 From Ashdod refinery, a
subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed company Paz Retail and Energy Ltd. provides jet
fuel to the Israeli Air Force202 operating in Gaza.
60.
By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing to civilian
infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation and now weaponizes in the
destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza.203 The same infrastructure that these companies supply
resources into has serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven
obliteration of Gaza. The ostensibly civilian nature of such infrastructure does not exonerate
a company from responsibility.204

Agribusiness has thrived on Israel-led extractivism and land-grabbing – producing
goods and technologies serving Israeli settler-colonial interests, expanding market

Tnuva, the largest food conglomerate in Israel, now majority-owned by the Chinese
Bright Food (Group) Co., Ltd.,206 has fuelled and benefited from land dispossession. Tnuva’s
Chairman recognized that “agriculture … in general and dairy farming in particular are a
strategic resource and a significant pillar in the settlement enterprise”.207 Israel has used
kibbutzim and agricultural outposts to seize Palestinian land and replace Palestinians. 208
Companies like Tnuva help by sourcing products from these colonies, 209 then exploit the
resulting captive Palestinian market210 to build market dominance.211 Palestinian dependence
on the Israeli dairy industry has increased 160 per cent in the decade following destruction
caused by Israel to Gaza’s dairy industry in 2014, amounting to sector losses estimated at
$43 million.212 Tnuva has absorbed the loss of the Gaza market,213 failing to use its substantial
leverage to influence the situation.

Netafim, a global leader in drip irrigation technology, now 80 per cent owned by the
Mexican company Orbia Advance Corporation,214 has designed its agritech in concert with
the expansion imperatives of Israel.215 While maintaining a global image of sustainability,216
Netafim technology has enabled intensive exploitation of water and land in the West Bank, 217
further depleting Palestinian natural resources, while being refined through collaboration
with Israeli military-technology firms.218 In the Jordan Valley, Netafim-aided irrigation
systems have facilitated Israeli crop expansion,219 while Palestinian farmers – denied water220
and with 93 per cent unirrigated land221 – are pushed out, unable to compete with Israeli
production.222 Furthermore, such irrigation techniques threaten to exhaust the Jordan River
and Dead Sea.223

Israelis,224 while the food system to which they belong causes food insecurity – and even
famine – for others. Netafim brands itself as a sustainable innovator, while perfecting ageold techniques of colonial exploitation.
Global retail
65.
Israeli products, including those from colonies, flood global markets through major
retailers,225 often with no scrutiny. To dodge growing backlash, companies mask origin
through misleading labels, barcodes and supply-chain mixing,226 effectively making
occupation shelf-ready.
66.
Global logistics giants like A.P. Moller – Maersk A/S are integral to this ecosystem;
for years they have shipped goods from the colonies and OHCHR database-listed companies
straight to the United States227 and other markets.228
67.
In many countries, no distinction is made between products from Israel and those from
its colonies. Even in the European Union, where labelling is required,229 these goods are still
allowed on the market,230 and the responsibility is put on uninformed consumers. Given the
illegality of the colonies under international law, these products should not be traded at all.
68.
Supermarket chains,231 including many listed in the OHCHR database, and ecommerce platforms such as Amazon.com232 operate directly in colonies, sustaining their
economy, enabling expansion and participating in apartheid through discriminatory service
delivery.
Occupation tourism
69.
Major online travel platforms, used by millions to reserve accommodation, profit from
the occupation by selling tourism that sustains the colonies, excludes Palestinians, promotes
settler narratives and legitimizes annexation.
70.
Booking Holdings Inc. and Airbnb, Inc. list properties and hotel rooms in Israeli
colonies. Booking.com has more than doubled its listings in the West Bank – from 26 in
2018233 to 70 by May 2023234 – and tripled its East Jerusalem listings to 39 in the year postOctober 2023.235 Airbnb has also amplified its colonial profiteering, growing from 139

are linked with restricting Palestinian access to land and endangering nearby villages. 239 In
Tekoa, Airbnb enables settler promotion of a “warm and loving community”,240
whitewashing settler violence against the neighbouring Palestinian village of Tuqu‘.241
71.
Booking.com and Airbnb have been in the OHCHR database since 2020.
Booking.com may label properties as “Palestinian territory, Israeli settlement”, but it
continues to profit from the colonies and faces criminal complaints in the Kingdom of the
Netherlands for laundering proceeds.242 Airbnb briefly delisted illegal colony properties in
2018243 but reversed course under pressure,244 now donating profits to “humanitarian” causes
and converting colonial profiteering into humanitarian-washing.245

C.

Enablers
72.
A list of enablers – financial, research, legal, consulting, media and advertising
firms246 – long involved in sustaining the settler-colonial occupation through knowledge,
narratives, skills and investment, have continued to support, profit from and normalize an
economy operating in genocidal mode. The present section is focused just on two key
enablers: the financial and academic sectors.
Financing the violations
73.
The financial sector channels critical funding to both State and corporate actors behind
the Israeli occupation and apartheid, despite many companies in the sector committing to the
Principles for Responsible Investment247 and the United Nations Global Compact.248
74.
As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have played
a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza. From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military
budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8
per cent deficit.249 Israel funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance,
including $8 billion in March 2024250 and $5 billion in February 2025,251 alongside issuances
on its domestic new shekel market.252 Some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP

Paribas253 and Barclays,254 stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these
international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate
premium, despite a credit downgrade.255 Asset management firms – including Blackrock ($68
million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960
million)256 – were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them. 257
Meanwhile, the Development Corporation for Israel (i.e., Israel Bonds)258 provides a bond
solicitation service for the Government of Israel for overseas private individuals and other
investors.259 The Development Corporation for Israel tripled its annual bond sales to funnel
nearly $5 billion to Israel since October 2023,260 while offering investors the option of
sending the return on bond investments to charitable organizations supporting the Israeli
military261 and the colonies.262
75.
These financial entities channel billions of dollars into treasury bonds and companies
directly involved in Israeli occupation and genocide. Blackrock (and its subsidiary,
iShares263) and Vanguard are among the largest institutional investors in many companies,
holding these shares for distribution among their indexes of mutual funds and electronically
traded funds (ETFs). Blackrock is the second largest institutional investor in Palantir (8.6 per
cent), Microsoft (7.8 per cent), Amazon.com (6.6 per cent), Alphabet (6.6 per cent) and IBM
(8.6 per cent), and third largest in Lockheed Martin (7.2 per cent) and Caterpillar (7.5 per
cent); Vanguard is the largest institutional investor in Caterpillar (9.8 per cent), Chevron (8.9
per cent) and Palantir (9.1 per cent), and second largest in Lockheed Martin (9.2 per cent)
and Elbit Systems (2.0 per cent).264 Through their asset management, they implicate
universities, pension funds and ordinary people who passively invest their savings through
the purchase of their funds and electronically traded funds.265 For their investment decisions,
these companies often rely on benchmark indices, such as FTSE All-World ex-US, J.P.
Morgan $ EM Corp Bond UCITS and MSCI ACWI UCITS,266 which are developed by
financial services firms.
76.
Global insurance companies, including Allianz and AXA, also invest large sums in
shares and bonds implicated in the occupation and genocide, partly as capital reserves for
policyholder claims and regulatory requirements, but primarily to generate returns. Allianz

holds at least $7.3 billion267 and AXA, despite some divestment decisions,268 still invests at
least $4.09 billion269 in tracked companies named in the present report. Their insurance
policies also underwrite the risks other companies necessarily take when operating in Israel
and the occupied Palestinian territory, thus enabling the commission of human rights
abuses270 and “de-risking” the operational environment.271
77.
Sovereign wealth and pension funds are also significant financiers. The world’s
largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund , claims it has the
world’s most comprehensive ethical guidelines.272 After October 2023, the Fund increased
its investment in Israeli companies by 32 per cent to $1.9 billion. By the end of 2024, the
Fund had $121.5 billion – 6.9 per cent of its total value – invested in companies named in the
present report alone.273 The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which manages Can$
473.3 billion ($328.9 billion)274 in pension funds for six million Canadians, has almost Can$
9.6 billion ($6.67 billion) invested in companies named in the present report,275 despite its
sustainable investment policy and human rights policy.276 From 2023 to 2024, it almost
tripled investment in Lockheed Martin, quadrupled investment in Caterpillar and increased
10-fold the investment in HD Hyundai.277
78.
The financial sector also allows companies to access funds through loans and by
underwriting their debt so they can sell it on the private bond market. From 2021 to 2023,
BNP Paribas was a top European financier of the weapons industry supplying Israel,
providing $410 million in loans to Leonardo, among others,278 alongside $5.2 billion in loans
and underwriting for OHCHR database-listed companies.279 Similarly, in 2024, Barclays
provided $2 billion in loans and underwriting to OHCHR database-listed companies,280 $862
million to Lockheed Martin and $228 million to Leonardo. 281
79.
This direct investment is buttressed by the choice of financial advisory companies and
responsible investment associations to not consider human rights violations in the occupied
Palestinian territory in their assessment of environmental, social and governance (ESG)
investing.282 This allows responsible/ethical investment funds to remain environmental,

This entire environment has facilitated a record 179 per cent increase in United States
dollar-equivalent equity prices of the companies listed in the Tel Aviv stock exchange since
the start of the assault on Gaza, translating into a $157.9 billion gain.284
81.
Faith-based charities have also become key financial enablers of illegal projects,
including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions abroad despite
strict regulatory charitable frameworks.285 The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over
20 affiliates fund settler expansion and military-linked projects.286 Since October 2023,
platforms such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible crowdfunding in 32 countries for

Meanwhile, science and technology departments serve as research and development hubs for
collaborations between the Israeli military and arms contractors, including Elbit Systems,
Israel Aerospace Industries, IBM and Lockheed Martin, and so contribute to producing the
tools for surveillance, crowd control, urban warfare, facial recognition and targeted killing ,
tools that are effectively tested on Palestinians.298
83.
Leading universities, especially from global-minority countries, partner with Israeli
institutions in areas directly harming Palestinians. At the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, labs conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry
of Defense – the only foreign military financing research at the Institute.299 Notable Israeli
Ministry of Defense projects include drone swarm control300 – a distinct feature of the Israeli
assault on Gaza since October 2023 – pursuit algorithms301 and underwater surveillance.302
From 2019 to 2024, the Institute managed a Lockheed Martin seed fund connecting students

Industrial Liaison Program, enabling access to research and talent. 304I

military drones used in Gaza.310 The University partners with IBM Israel – which runs the
discriminatory Israeli Population Registry – on cloud and artificial intelligence systems, as
part of the €7.75 million ($8.52 million) IBM Israel receives in Horizon funding.311 The
University also collaborates on a €10.76 million ($11.71 million) project on “seamless shared
urban mobility” that includes the Municipality of Jerusalem,312 a city entrenching annexation
through urban transportation. It is impossible to disentangle the expertise that Israeli partners
contribute to these partnerships from that gained and used in violations to which they are
connected.
85.
Many universities have upheld ties with Israel despite the post-October 2023
escalation. One of many British examples,313 the University of Edinburgh holds nearly £25.5
million ($31.72 million) (2.5 per cent of its endowment) in four tech giants – Alphabet,
Amazon, Microsoft and IBM314 – central to the Israeli surveillance apparatus and the ongoing
Gaza destruction. With both direct and indexed investments, the University ranks among the
most financially entangled institutions in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland. The University also partners with firms aiding Israeli military operations, including
Leonardo S.p.A.315 and Ben-Gurion University, through the AI and Data Science Lab at BenGurion University,316 sharing research that directly links it with assaults on Palestinians.
86.
The analysis in the present report only scratches the surface of the information
received by the Special Rapporteur, who acknowledges the vital work of students and staff
in holding universities to account. It casts a new light on global crackdowns on campus
protesters: shielding Israel and protecting institutional financial interests appears a more
probable motivation than fighting alleged antisemitism. 317

V. Conclusions
87.
While life in Gaza is being obliterated and the West Bank is under escalating
assault, the present report shows why the genocide carried out by Israel continues:
because it is lucrative for many. By shedding light on the political economy of an
occupation turned genocidal, the report reveals how the forever-occupation has become
the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and big tech – providing boundless
supply and demand, little oversight and zero accountability – while investors and
private and public institutions profit freely. Too many influential corporate entities
remain inextricably financially bound to Israeli apartheid and militarism.
88.
Post-October 2023, as the Israeli defence budget has doubled, and at a time of
falling demand, production and consumer confidence, an international network of
corporations has propped up the Israeli economy. Blackrock and Vanguard rank
among the largest investors in arms companies pivotal to the genocidal arsenal of Israel.
Major global banks have underwritten Israeli treasury bonds, which have bankrolled
the devastation, and the largest sovereign wealth and pension funds invested public and

private savings in the genocidal economy, all the while claiming to respect ethical
guidelines.
89.
Arms companies have turned over near record profits by equipping Israel with
cutting-edge weaponry that has devastated a virtually defenceless civilian population.
The machinery of global construction equipment giants has been instrumental in razing
Gaza to the ground, preventing the return and reconstitution of Palestinian life.
Extractive energy and mining conglomerates, while providing sources of civilian
energy, have fuelled the military and energy infrastructures of Israel – both used to
create conditions of life calculated to destroy the Palestinian people.
90.
And while the genocide rages on, the inexorable process of violent annexation in
the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continues. Agribusiness still sustains
expansion of the settlement enterprise. The largest online tourism platforms continue
normalizing the illegality of Israeli colonies. Global supermarkets continue to stock
Israeli settlement products. And universities worldwide, under the guise of research
neutrality, continue to profit from an economy now operating in genocidal mode.
Indeed, they are structurally dependent on settler-colonial collaborations and funding.
91.
Business continues as usual, but nothing about this system, in which businesses
are integral, is neutral. The enduring ideological, political and economic engine of racial
capitalism has transformed the Israeli displacement-replacement economy of
occupation into an economy of genocide. This is a “joint criminal enterprise”, 318 where
the acts of one ultimately contribute to a whole economy that drives, supplies and
enables this genocide.
92.
The entities named in the present report constitute a fraction of a much deeper
structure of corporate involvement, profiteering from and enabling violations and
crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory. Had they exercised due diligence,
corporate entities would have ceased involvement with Israel long ago. Today, the
demand for accountability is all the more urgent: any investment sustains a system of
serious international crimes.
93.
Business and human rights obligations cannot be isolated from the Israeli illegal
settler-colonial enterprise in the occupied Palestinian territory, which now functions as
a genocidal machine, despite the International Court of Justice having ordered that it
be fully and unconditionally dismantled. Corporate relations with Israel must cease
until the occupation and apartheid end and reparations are made. The corporate sector,
including its executives, must be held to account, as a necessary step towards ending the
genocide and disassembling the global system of racialized capitalism that underpins it.

VI. Recommendations
94.

The Special Rapporteur urges Member States:

(a)
To impose sanctions and a full arms embargo on Israel, including all
existing agreements and dual-use items such as technology and civilian heavy
machinery;
(b)
To suspend or prevent all trade agreements and investment relations, and
impose sanctions, including asset freezes, on entities and individuals involved in
activities that may endanger the Palestinians;
(c)
To enforce accountability, ensuring that corporate entities face legal
consequences for their involvement in serious violations of international law.
95.

The Special Rapporteur urges corporate entities:

(a)
To promptly cease all business activities and terminate relationships
directly linked with, contributing to and causing human rights violations and

international crimes against the Palestinian people, in accordance with international
corporate responsibilities and the law of self-determination;
(b)
To pay reparations to the Palestinian people, including in the form of an
apartheid wealth tax along the lines of post-apartheid South Africa.
96.
The Special Rapporteur urges the International Criminal Court and national
judiciaries to investigate and prosecute corporate executives and/or corporate entities
for their part in the commission of international crimes and laundering of the proceeds
from those crimes.
97.

The Special Rapporteur urges the United Nations:
(a)

To comply with the International Court of Justice advisory opinion of

2024;
(b)
To include all entities involved in Israeli unlawful occupation in the
OHCHR database (to be properly accessible on the OHCHR website).
98.
The Special Rapporteur urges trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary
citizens to press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and
accountability at the international and domestic levels; together, the people of the world
can end these unspeakable crimes.
99.
The present report is written at the cusp of a profound and tumultuous
transformation. Globally witnessed atrocities require urgent accountability and justice,
which demand diplomatic, economic and legal action against those who have
maintained and profited from an economy of occupation turned genocidal. What comes
next depends on everyone.

Annex
Overview of the legal framework governing the legal responsibility of
corporate entities in the occupied Palestinian territory
1.

Introduction
1.
This annex sets out the international legal framework broadly applicable to the
corporate sector implicated in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). It aims to provide
guidance on the interpretation and application of the legal concepts and factual findings
presented in the main report. Not intended as an exhaustive exposition of international law in
this domain, it presents the broad principles of corporate responsibility, particularly those
applicable where corporate entities1 are implicated in displacing Palestinians from their land
and replacing them with unlawful colonies, contrary to international law. Corporate entities
risk being held responsible for exploitative, abusive and even criminal conduct. Although
corporate responsibility for and criminal complicity in violations was certainly identifiable
in the oPt prior to October 2023, subsequent factual and legal developments could implicate
corporations in unlawful occupation and genocide.

2.

Corporate responsibility under international law
2.
Corporate responsibility for violations of human rights, international humanitarian
law and crimes under international law is governed by legal instruments at the domestic,
regional and international levels.
3.
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) constitute the
normative framework at the international level for the regulation of corporate conduct with
respect to human rights.2 They set out what states and corporate entities need to do in order
to comply with existing obligations under international human rights law, and are already
having a significant impact on national law and policy. Indeed, the UNGPs provide the
normative lens through which corporate conduct can be assessed in order to establish legally
relevant facts in litigation where corporate liability is addressed. They are concerned both
with preventing adverse human rights impacts and ensuring remedial actions are taken where
a corporation’s conduct causes, contributes, or is directly linked to such impacts.3 Crucially,
heightened normative requirements apply in contexts of conflict, occupation and structural
vulnerability, especially where domestic enforcement of international human rights law may
be weak or compromised, rendering international oversight necessary.4
4.
Other areas of international law establish specific legal obligations for corporations,
especially international humanitarian law – which is binding on non-State actors involved in
armed conflict5 – and international criminal law, under which individuals such as corporate
executives, and increasingly corporate entities themselves, can be held criminally liable. 6
Domestic courts are the primary jurisdiction for the enforcement of corporate responsibility
for human rights violations and international crimes.
2.1. States as the primary duty-bearers
5.
International law accords States the primary role of ensuring that corporate entities do
not violate international law and respect human rights, as part of their obligation to respect,
protect and fulfil human rights. Under international human rights law, confirmed by the

UNGPs, States may be found in breach of their human rights obligations where they fail to
take appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish and redress abuses by private actors
when human rights violations occur.7 States have an obligation to extend this regulation and
oversight to the operations of corporations that occur outside their territory, in accordance
with general extraterritorial human rights obligations.8
6.
Furthermore, under the rules on State responsibility, violations of human rights by
private actors will be attributed to a State where a corporate entity acts on instructions from
or under the control or direction of the State, is empowered by State legislation to exercise
elements of governmental authority or where the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct
as its own.9 Accordingly, the UNGPs require States to take additional steps to protect against
human rights abuse by corporate entities owned, controlled by or receiving substantial
support from the State.10
2.2. Responsibilities of corporate entities
7.
The UNGPs apply to all corporate enterprises, “regardless of their size, sector,
operational context, ownership and structure.”11 The responsibility of corporate entities for
human rights violations and crimes under international law exists independently from that of
States and irrespective of the action States do or do not take to ensure they respect human
rights. Consequently, corporations must respect human rights even if a State where they
operate does not, and they may be held accountable even if they have complied with the
domestic laws where they operate.12 In other words, compliance with domestic laws does not
preclude/is not a defense to responsibility or liability.
8.
Corporate entities are obliged both to avoid violating human rights law and to address
human rights violations resulting from their own activities or their business relationships with
others. To achieve this, the UNGPs establish a “continuum of involvement” and associated
responsibilities. These reflect the complexity of corporate structures and economic value
chains, and the fact that the nature of a company’s involvement in a particular human rights
impact may shift over time, so that if it does not take appropriate action, it could move up
that continuum. The activities of a corporate entity and its relationships can be seen as part
of an ecosystem, which may altogether (by perpetrating, facilitating, enabling and/or
profiting) adversely impact human rights, resulting in violations. 13
9.
A corporate entity’s responsibility depends primarily on whether its activities or
relationships throughout its supply/value chain14 risk, or are in fact:
(a) causing human rights violations15, due to its own activities being essential to the
human rights abuse being able to occur.16
(b) contributing to violations through its own activities – either directly or through
some outside entity (government, business or other). This includes any activity or
relationship where a causal link can be established between the corporate entity’s

actions and the resulting violation.17 Causality between the entity’s actions and the
resulting abuse will be considered to exist where it has facilitated or enabled the
abuse, created strong incentives for a third party to breach international human
rights law or undertaken activities “in parallel with a third party, leading to
cumulative impacts”.18
(c) directly linked to violations through its operations, products, services or corporate
relationships, although it need not itself be contributing to the abuses.19
10.
The UNGPs expect corporate entities to ensure that they are not implicated in human
rights violations by undertaking periodic human rights due diligence (HRDD) to identify
concerns and adjust their conduct.20 Additionally, in situations of armed conflict, occupation
and other instances of widespread violence, corporate entities are expected to engage in
heightened human rights due diligence throughout the period of the conflict.21
11.
As part of this heightened process – which is imperative in the oPt – corporate entities
should ask themselves three questions regarding their actions and omissions:
(a) Is there an actual or potential adverse impact on human rights or is the conflict
connected either to the corporate entity’s activities, products or services?
(b) If so, do the corporate entity’s activities increase the risk of that impact?
(c) If so, would the corporate entity’s activities in and of themselves be sufficient to
result in that impact?22
12.

13.

In answering these questions, corporate entities must consider:
●

Conflict will always create adverse negative human rights impacts, therefore a
corporate entity operating in a conflict will always cause, contribute to or be
directly linked with human rights impacts;

●

Corporate activities in a conflict-affected area can never be ‘neutral’; even where
a corporate entity does not take sides in a conflict, its activities will inevitably
affect the conflict dynamics;

●

Corporate entities need to respect standards of international humanitarian law and
the obligation to prevent genocide, in addition to human rights. 23

Based on the above assessment, a corporate entity has particular legal responsibilities:
(a) Where it causes human rights violations (answers “yes” to all three questions), it
has a responsibility to cease the action, and to provide remedies and reparations
for harm caused.24

(b) Where it contributes to human rights violations (answers “yes” to questions 1 and
2, “no” to 3), it has a responsibility to take the necessary steps to cease or prevent
its own contribution to human rights violations (including terminating
relationships), to mitigate any remaining impact through its leverage and to
cooperate in the remediation of the harm.25
(c) Where it is directly linked to human rights violations (answers “yes” only to
question 1), it is required to use its leverage, including collaboratively, to prevent
or mitigate the impact on human rights.26 Should that leverage prove ineffective,
it must consider terminating relationships.27 Failure to disengage from a high-risk
context (despite due diligence) will increase a corporate entity’s liability for the
violation.28
14.
A crucial and often misunderstood aspect of the framework is that when assessing
corporate actions, it is the material impact of corporate actions on the current and potential
protection of human rights and the conflict-affected context itself that matters,29 and not the
degree of diligence exercised or the degree of negligence. 30 In other words, conducting this
due diligence will not absolve a corporate entity of responsibility.31 What matters is the
human rights impacts and the actions taken to avert or address the risk.
15.
Correctly identifying the violation in question is therefore crucial. This means
corporate entities must consider whether specific human rights violations may also be
constitutive of more structural and systemic violations of international law. 32 According to
the UNGPs, the severity of the human rights impacts will determine their responsibilities and
the sufficiency of the steps taken to prevent, cease and remedy the serious violations. 33 For
example, a corporate entity may be contributing to home demolitions and forced
displacement. However, in a context of settlement expansion, or more structural crimes, the
corporate entity’s actions may also be directly linked to the maintenance of apartheid, racial
discrimination and genocide, or contributing to those violations, when systematic forced
displacement is a constitutive component of these crimes as they unfold. They are also
inherently contributing to the violation of the right to self-determination.
16.
Additionally, the complexity of expected HRDD processes and the urgency with
which corporate entities must act is proportional to the scale, scope and irremediability of the
violations occurring.34 In situations where there is clear evidence of ongoing, widespread
human rights violations, the corporate entity must treat the risk of involvement as a legal
compliance issue and, in the most extreme circumstances, cease operations in the State in
question. Heightened HRDD enables corporate entities to anticipate escalations in the
violations, and take the requisite action before those violations materialise.35 Failure to do so
affects the degree of involvement and the extent to which their actions will be considered
sufficient, impacting liability assessments. Thus a corporate entity directly linked to home

demolitions and failing to terminate its relationships will find itself contributing to that
violation, carrying greater responsibilities.36
2.3. When responsibility may entail criminal liability
17.
Failure to act responsibly in line with international law may implicate corporate
entities in more serious violations giving rise to criminal liability, for the corporate entity
and/or for its executives.
18.
Drawn from the legacy of the Industrialists’ trials at Nuremberg,37 corporate
accountability for international crimes is based on a recognition of the critical role the
economy plays in times of war and conflict,38 and the fact that corporate entities may be
involved in heinous violations of international law constituting international crimes.

Individual executives can be held criminally liable for the actions of their corporate
entities, including before the International Criminal Court.39 While, increasingly, corporate
entities themselves, could also face criminal liability as a result of the emerging
crystallization of customary international legal principles.40 This includes some domestic
jurisdictions which attribute criminal liability to corporations,41 and a growing body of
treaties enshrine criminal liability of legal persons, which means that under international law
corporations can be criminally liable for specific crimes, including genocide,42 apartheid,43
financing terrorism,44 organized crime45 and corruption.46
20.
The conduct of corporations and their executives may entail direct criminal liability
but more commonly constitutes complicity or aiding and abetting liability. This may involve
instigating, moral support,47 or abetting, furnishing aid or assistance for or procuring the
means for the commission of a crime48 or the creation of conditions necessary for atrocity
crimes to occur.49 International tribunals have generally found that criminal liability for such
forms of complicity: (a) can be established where the aid or assistance has a material effect

on the commission of the crime,50 and (b) depends on the knowledge possessed by the
entity/executive of how its services or activities will be utilised, and the effect on the
commission of the crime.51
21.
In other words, it is not necessary to show that the entity or individual intended the
particular harm; it is sufficient that in providing logistical, financial or operational support,
they had actual or constructive knowledge that the principal perpetrators were engaged in a
given crime,52 or, in the case of prosecutions before the ICC, acted “for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of such a crime”.53 Financial and managerial control over a
corporate entity engaged in the crime is sufficient to establish the basis for individual criminal
responsibility.54 Jurisprudence has confirmed that corporate actors cannot avoid
accountability by claiming that they were merely fulfilling commercial contracts. 55
2.4. Mechanisms of enforcement
22.
This international framework is enforceable via a range of mechanisms – particularly
at the domestic and regional levels – established by States in order to fulfil the legal
obligations outlined in Section 2.1.
23.
For many corporate actors a key incentive to uphold practices that respect human
rights is the risk of reputational damage arising from their involvement in human rights
violations and international crimes. The UN Database (see 3.1 below),56 for instance, has
significantly promoted awareness of corporate responsibility in the oPt and contributed to
divestment decisions.
24.
An examination of all legislative and policy mechanisms adopted by states is beyond
the scope of this report. In many jurisdictions, corporate violations of jus cogens norms,
customary international law, international criminal law and international human rights law
are enforceable in courts, while in others domestic criminal laws, tortious and negligence
laws, and contract laws provide useful mechanisms for victims. The UNGPs can and should
be consistently used to provide the normative lens to assess corporate conduct and establish
legally relevant facts.
25.
Examples of corporate accountability for violations of international law include: in
the UK for toxic emissions from a subsidiary-run copper mine,57 in the Netherlands for the
supply of nerve gas to Iraq,58 in France for payments to armed groups to keep a cement factory
50

Note: the most common criminal standard requires “a substantial effect” on the commission of the crime: International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Prosecutor v. Tadic, Case No. IT-94-1-T, 7 May 1997, paras. 688-692; while the ICC does not
set such a high standard, an “effect” is sufficient: International Criminal Court, Prosecutor v. Bemba, Case No. ICC-01/05-01/13,

civil suit under the Alien Torts Statute, under which US courts can hold American
corporations accountable for “violation[s] of the law of nations”,61 led to settlement with a
US oil company for its complicity in violations in Myanmar.62
26.
Where a corporate entity profits from actions that constitute an international crime
(e.g., a war crime, genocide, apartheid or an act of aggression), this may also form the
predicate crime for an offence under money laundering and proceeds of crime legislation that
exists in many domestic jurisdictions,63 which, if successfully proven, can infect all corporate
dealings along the supply chain, such as provision of insurance, tech services, legal
accountancy and banking services.64
27.
Domestic human rights due diligence laws now exist in several states, including
France,65 Germany,66 Norway67 and Switzerland,68 and the number can be expected to
increase across EU states following the adoption of the EU Directive on Corporate
Sustainability Due Diligence in July 2024,69 subject to proposed amendments.70 These laws
establish mechanisms for supervision and enforcement through injunctive orders and
effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. 71 They are often complemented by
regulations applicable to particular sectors, such as dual-use cyber-surveillance items,72
forced labour73 and non-financial reporting entities.74
28.
The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business
Conduct have opened new opportunities for scrutiny.75 These require all 51 adhering States,
including Israel,76 to establish National Contact Points (NCPs) to promote the guidelines and
create a non-judicial grievance mechanism allowing NGOs, trade unions, affected individuals
and communities to lodge complaints about the direct operations or supply chains of

Where direct remedies are not available against corporate entities, it may be possible
to hold States responsible for failing to comply with their obligations vis-a-vis corporate
entities within their jurisdiction.79
3. Applying the framework to the occupied Palestinian territory
30.
In the case of the oPt, corporate entities have been on notice for decades regarding
the widespread and systematic nature of the human rights violations perpetrated there. Proper
human rights due diligence would have identified the risk of corporate entities incurring
responsibility for such violations well before the catastrophic events that have unfolded since
October 2023 – all the more so if the required heightened processes were followed.
3.1. An inherently unlawful context, gradually exposed
31.
Since 1967, Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups,80 the United Nations main
organs81 as well as UN treaty bodies,82 special rapporteurs,83 investigative committees84 and
major international NGOs – including Human Rights Watch,85 Amnesty International,86 Save
the Children87 and Oxfam88 – have systematically documented the Israeli occupation’s many
violations, including the economic structures that sustain it.
32.
In its 2004 Advisory Opinion, the ICJ found that Israel’s construction of the Wall in
the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, violated peremptory norms of international law,
including the right to self-determination, the prohibition on annexation and obligations under
international humanitarian and human rights law, including the crime of forced
displacement.89
33.
The 2004 Advisory Opinion laid the foundation for civil society responses such as the
BDS campaign90 and initiatives by other actors91 who have mobilized around the principle
that those who profit from occupation should be held accountable. In response to mounting
pressure, as well as internal risk assessments and strategic considerations, several companies
have taken action. Some corporations have divested – for example, KLP from Caterpillar,92

In 2016, the UN Human Rights Council adopted resolution A/HRC/RES/31/36,
pursuant to which the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights established a
database in 2020 (‘UN database’) listing business enterprises that have “directly and
indirectly enabled, facilitated and profited from the construction and growth of the
settlements”, identifying ten specific types of activities. 103 Its most recent iteration, updated
in 2023, lists 97 companies.104 While it does not cover the full gamut of relevant activities,
the database captures critical components of the complex matrix of corporate entities
involved in the displacement and replacement of the Palestinians.
3.2. Seismic shift: international court proceedings
35.
Recent legal developments concerning the oPt have significantly reshaped the
assessment of corporate responsibility and potential liability.
36.
Most significant is the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024, which addressed the
legality of Israel’s very presence in the oPt. The Court declared the prolonged presence of
Israel in the whole of the territory, including its colony regime – composed of its military
presence, settlements, associated infrastructures and control of Palestinian natural
resources105 – as illegal106 in its entirety on the basis of sustained violations of two peremptory
norms of international law: the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and the
prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force (annexation).107 The Court also recognized,
among others, the violation of the non-derogable norm prohibiting racial segregation and
apartheid.108
37.
The ICJ’s finding of a violation of the prohibition on the use of force effectively
qualifies the occupation as an act of aggression.109 Consequently, any dealings that support
or sustain the occupation and its associated apparatus may amount to complicity in an
international crime under the Rome Statute. 110 While Israel, as the de facto occupying power,
remains bound by international humanitarian law, the illegality of the occupation means all
administrative and military actions it undertakes in the oPt – from controlling visas, permits

and movement, to incarceration and economic regulation – lack lawful authority under
international law and should be considered invalid.111
38.
Second, the recognition by the ICJ of the violation of the right to selfdetermination in turn informs the interpretation of all human rights and other legal
obligations that flow therefrom. As the Court said, the right to self-determination is the
most fundamental and existential right for all human beings, as it pertains to the inherent
capability of a people to exist and determine themselves as a people in a given territory, free
from foreign control and occupation.112 Without this right, a people are unable to exercise
control over their lives and resources in the territory recognized under international law as
their own.113
39.
On the basis of the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion, the UN General Assembly demanded that
Israel bring to an end its unlawful presence in the oPt by 17 September 2025. 114 Until that
happens, States must not provide aid or assistance or enter into economic or trade dealings,
and must take steps to prevent trade or investment relations that would assist in maintaining
the illegal situation created by Israel in the oPt.115 It should be emphasized that the failure of
States to act on the ICJ ruling does not absolve corporate entities of their responsibilities
under international law and the UNGPs.
3.3. Atrocity crimes
40.
This sustained situation of illegality with impunity, with its associated violations of
international law and international crimes, has predictably given rise to further egregious
violations, amounting to atrocity crimes, committed since October 2023. These have in turn
precipitated the opening by the ICJ and ICC of proceedings concerning Israel: the former
relating to genocide, the latter to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
41.
On 26 January 2024, following the South Africa v. Israel proceedings under the
Genocide Convention, the ICJ ordered Israel to take “all measures” within its power to
prevent genocidal acts against Palestinians, 116 and in May 2024, the Court ordered Israel to
“immediately halt” military operations that may bring about conditions of life intended to
destroy.117 In separate proceedings, Nicaragua v Germany, the ICJ reminded all States “of
their international obligations relating to the transfer of arms118 to parties to an armed conflict,
in order to avoid the risk that such arms might be used to violate” international law. 119
42.
By placing States on explicit notice of this risk of genocide, the ICJ orders engaged
the obligation under Article 1 of the Genocide Convention to “prevent and punish” genocide,
thereby exposing all those who continue to aid, abet or assist Israel in committing such acts
to potential international responsibility for complicity in genocide.
43.
In November 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants in the Situation in the State of
Palestine for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav
Gallant, on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to believe that they bear criminal
responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The above legal developments have significantly reshaped the assessment of
corporate responsibility and potential liability, which must now be interpreted in light of these
orders and decisions of international courts.
45.
The scale and severity of violations occurring throughout Israel’s decades-long
military occupation – which has helped entrench a settler-colonial apartheid regime – should
already have alerted corporate actors to their responsibility to avoid causing, contributing to
or being directly linked to ongoing human rights violations, and the possibility that they may
have been complicit in the commission of international crimes, such as by aiding and abetting
and facilitating them. The political economy of Israel’s occupation set out in the report, is
illustrative of the entwinement of all manner of corporate activities with the displacement
and replacement of Palestinians in the oPt. At a minimum, this directly linked these corporate
activities with an entrenched and structural set of violations that almost certainly already
triggered the responsibility of corporate entities to cease engagement linked to the oPt under
the UNGPs, on the basis of their limited capacity to wield influence in order to prevent or
mitigate the adverse impact. But the recent and ongoing ICJ and ICC proceedings have
removed any possible doubt and put corporate entities – whether subsidiaries, parent
companies or direct actors and investors – clearly on notice of the serious risk of being
implicated in very serious violations of international law, including human rights violations
and international crimes, and of their actions having contributed to or become criminally
complicit in these violations and crimes.
46.
Israel’s ongoing illegal occupation of the oPt creates an untenable situation for
corporate entities to simply continue business as usual. The finding that the occupation is per
se illegal, and that international crimes, including genocide, and arguably the crime of
aggression, may have been committed, has gone far beyond a “heightened risk” of adverse
human rights impact. The private sector must, in its own interests, urgently reconsider all
engagement connected to Israel’s economy of occupation and now genocide.
47.
A consequence of the ICJ Advisory Opinion is a requirement for heightened human
rights due diligence on the part of corporate entities, which must now address the fundamental
illegality at the heart of Israel’s enterprise. They can no longer limit their legal assessments
and mitigation measures to questions of Israel’s specific conduct and whether certain human
rights (e.g., environmental, workers’ or children’s rights or lack of fair trial guarantees) and
humanitarian frameworks are respected.120 For example, the incarceration of thousands of
Palestinians, whether in administrative detention or after being convicted in military courts,
is unlawful due to the lack of legal authority and because it is part of a governance system
using mass incarceration of Palestinians as a tool of systemic repression and forced
displacement, and not merely due to the absence of fair trial guarantees. The Advisory
Opinion also signals that corporate entities must recognize the primacy of the right to selfdetermination and its interpretive function in the construction of all other human rights
protections.121 This means human rights policies and environmental, social and governance
frameworks cannot continue to overlook the right to self-determination, which is firmly
embedded within human rights law,122 recognized as a foundational right of all peoples, and
the prerequisite to all other rights.123
48.
It also means recognizing that any engagement with the Palestinian people and in the
oPt must comply with their right to self-determination. This supersedes paternalistic
justifications based on the fiduciary obligations of the occupying power under the Fourth
Geneva Convention, and invalidates specious justifications by corporate entities, such as that
an investment through Israel as the occupier can eventually benefit the Palestinians as well,
or that divestment would have adverse human rights impacts.124

49.
The ICJ Advisory Opinion, endorsed by the UN General Assembly, imposes a prima
facie responsibility on corporate entities to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and
unconditionally from any dealings with any component of the occupation. Where corporate
entities disregard this notice, fail to abide by their responsibilities under the UNGPs and
continue engagement through their activities and relationships with Israel, its economy, its
military and private sector connected to the oPt, they knowingly contribute to or cause
violations, including the denial of the Palestinian right to self-determination, the permanent
annexation of Palestinian territory or the maintenance of Israel's unlawful occupation of
Palestinian territory. The escalation in legal responsibility arises also because ongoing
sustainment of any relationships and activities in such a serious context, contributes to
legitimating Israeli conduct and furthering impunity which in turn leads to ever more
egregious conduct. Normalisation of the illegal is essential to the survival of Israel's settlercolonial enterprise.
50.
Now, this is a political economy that was always eliminatory and has turned into
genocidal mode. Confirming this, the ICJ Provisional Measures and ICC Arrest Warrants
signal the risk that corporate entities – and their executives – that engage in the oPt are
implicated in serious international crimes. Any decision to continue engagement in Israel’s
economy is therefore done with knowledge of the crimes that may be taking place, and of the
fact that they may provide material support to Israel to continue to commit those crimes.
51.
Corporate entities and their executives can, and indeed must, find themselves liable in
civil or criminal law for such conduct, in addition to the multitude of other crimes and human
rights violations that are part of the economy of occupation. The actions entities and
executives do or do not take in accordance with their responsibilities, vis-a-vis these legal
developments and the UNGPs, have material relevance to key evidential questions that would
arise in the course of determining their civil and/or criminal liability.
